I created a Weather App by using HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript technologies. This app that helps to determine temperature across the globe at your fingertips. 
Weather  prediction  is  the  application  of  science  and  technology  to  predict  the  state  of  the atmosphere for a given location. Here this system will predict weather based on parameters such as  temperature,  humidity  and  wind.  This  system  is  a  web  application  with  effective  graphical user interface. 
There are a variety of weather mobile apps in Google Play and the App store. Those apps have great features and functionalities to satisfy users.
